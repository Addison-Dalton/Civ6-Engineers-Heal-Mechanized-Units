# Engineers Heal Mechanized Units - A Civilization 6 mod

## Description
Like medics, engineers can now provide healing to adjacent mechanized units.

The difference from medics is that engineers provide increased healing over what medics can provide. (30+ HP). Engineers can heal the following units:
- Bombard
- Tank
- Modern Armor
- Mechanized Infantry
- Artillery
- Rocket Artillery

## Compatibility
- Compatible with all official DLC
- Should be compatible with majority of mods.
- Save-game compatible, but will only effect newly created engineers.
